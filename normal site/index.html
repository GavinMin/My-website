      <h3>A quick lil bio</h3>
      <p>Well Ill start off telling you my name, my name is Gavin Minshew and I
        was born in 2003 in the city Portland Oregon. Before you jump to any
        conclusions of me being a hipster it is all false not all Portlandians
        are the stereotypical hipster, most of us are actually different than
        hipsters. But enough of that, lets get back on topic about my journey
        through life, so after Portland Oregon (I was only there for six months)
         my mom and dad (Allison and Nate Minshew) decided to move back to their home state,
        Missouri where for a while stayed with my great grandparents in a small
        town called Carthage while my dad had a job down there. Then my dad
        found a job oppurtunity in St. Louis We moved to a town called Clayton there.
        We stayed in Clayton while my dad was working (and still is) at a
        business called Asynchrony until I was six, and then my mom and dad
        grew sick of each other fighting all the time and ended up getting a
        divorce and my dad moved in with one of his friends Quan, which he
        stayed with until I want to say I was seven then later moved on to live with
        his friend Mike and stayed there until I was around nine. Later he got
        married to this woman named Casey who had a kid named Kenny who became
        my step-brother. My dad and Casey ended up having two other children
        named Lio and Natalie. And we ended up moving three times (so far). My
        mom on the other side ended up going to rent herself an apartment in
        Valley park still in St. Louis, a few years after that my mom had
        decided to move down to Grain Valley, MO a small town on the outer
        part of Kansas City. I went from 3rd to the beginning of 5th grade there
        Then my mom moved again to another small town called Parkville, MO Where
        I went to Graden Elementary and was introduced the most to laptops
        because we were all given them instead of paper and notebooks which is
        what I was used to. I then moved over to 6th grade which was one school
        which is when I took a coding class and got really into it, but Ill get
        more into that in the next paragraph. I then moved to 7th grade in a school
        called Congress Middle School, and then 8th which brings me to where I
        am now.

      <h3>My journey of being a programmer at 13</h3>
      <p>For me computer programming started in 6th grade whenever I was 12,
        Whenever I took a computer class and started to code using Khan Academy.
        Sadly, that class ended after 1st quarter and moved on to other boring
        classes, but I still got on Khan Academy from time to time just because
        it was fun. Then that summer I got with my dad telling him that I was
        getting into this whole coding thing, and him being a programmer, was
        pretty stoked about it and told me to just keep practicing, So I did.
        Then the next year turning 7th grade I had this computer class where we
        learned more comp-sci, but this time actually coding and I learned how
        to make an actual website using Microsoft notepad, which was pretty
        cool. That class lasted a whole semester and I enjoyed it all the way
        through. When that semester ended I made random websites for fun, the
        only problem was that I could only do the basics and got boring,
        luckily for me my dad was and still is a computer programmer and showed
        me this awesome website called W3schools (which I recommend for all
        people wanting to be coders) and started doing some more complicated
        code like CSS, JAVA, HTML5, and Bootstrap. Im in eighth grade now
        learning MIT App Inventor (which im not that big of a fan of) and still
        coding to this day.

          <h3>What I do</h3>
          <p>Now, ill tell you what I do. So even though I havent been coding
            that long I feel as if I need to teach the world about it. So I have
            Created all of these social media accounts and a YT channel to help
            beginners that are interested, mostly focusing on the basics to kick
            them off how to code. So if you have any questions, go to my discord
            or any image links located to the right and ask me anything you like
            (coding related).
